In this intense 3D FPS, Earth faces an existential threat as a colossal robot army descends. 
As a unique gun tower builder, your mission is clear: single-handedly defend a massive city, construct vital defenses, and unleash devastating firepower to repel the invasion.

## Description

This is my group's project for the "Game Programing" subject at school.
The game is a 3D FPS, set in the context of the Earth being invaded by a robot army and the player is a lone soldier who must fight against the sweeping attacks of the robot army to protect the earth.
